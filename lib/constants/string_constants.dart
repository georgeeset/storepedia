const String aboutApp =
    '''StorePedia is a robust database for keeping record of parts stored in the factoryâ€™s engineering store. This project was motivated by time loss while trying to locate required part at the spare part store.\n
  StorePedia works on the principle of active information collation. In this case, Store items information and location will be stored by approved app users in a central repository, where it can be queried and retrieved by the app 
  users in need of it. This app comes with the following features:\n
  Add and Edit Store Item: Users can either add non existing store items or Edit existing store items with latest information to enable others get more accurate information.\n

  Search Store Item: StorePedia search engine is quite smart with capability of using keywords and part description to locate closely related part with minimum latency.\n
  Access control: Users can only get access to this app if approval is granted by the Admin. Access level is used to control who can delete or add part to repository.\n
